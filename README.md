# Suricata Rules

This repository contains a large collection of rules for the Suricata intrusion detection system (IDS). Suricata is an open-source network IDS that can detect a wide range of threats, including malware, exploits, and other malicious activity. Our rules are designed to be highly effective at detecting web application attack especially detecting latest CVEs.

> This repository is heavily influenced by `nuclei-templates` repository by ProjectDiscovery

# Usage

`main.py` will merge all rules into one file

```python
python3 main.py --path=/path/to/rules
```
